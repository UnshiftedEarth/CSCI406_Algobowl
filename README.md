**Welcome to the CSCI406 Algobowl Group 23 repository**

## New Changes
Checkout the output_ver branch where I created an output verification method. This method reads in an output file and 
determines whether it is a valid solution to the problem by looking at two things:
- If the union of the subsets equals the universal set given in the matching input
- If the minimum weight equals the sum of all the subset weights
